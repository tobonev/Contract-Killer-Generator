This simple tools allow anyone to create a contract based on **[Contract Killer v3](https://gist.github.com/4031110)** the popular open-source contract for web designers and developers. It offers a sleek user
interface to edit the contract terms, and you can also export to PDF. Our tool is developed off of a common but efficient contract template which has been used by thousands of wen designers and developers to
create concise contracts.
